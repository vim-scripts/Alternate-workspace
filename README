 This script provide a way to quickly switch between files from different workspaces (Child and Parent). And to see difference between them.

Set variable g:aw_child_path and g:aw_parent_path to work with this script.

Example of vimrc:

   let g:aw_child_path = '/home/ni/branch'
   let g:aw_parent_path = '/project/' 
   let g:aw_stop_word = 'src'

   nnoremap \wd :AWDiffMirror<CR>
   nnoremap \we :AWEditMirror<CR>

EDIT MIRROR

Suppose you have two files in different workspaces.
You edit now file from child workspace.

you are at line 100
in that line is text 'int main()'

in alternate file there is line 'int main()' too but in line 200

after command :AWEditMirrorFile you will be at line 200 in alternate file
It is very useful.

if there is now such line in alternate file you'll be at line 100.

SET WORKSPACES 

Use AWSetChild and AWSetParent commands to set workspaces directories (thanks to Sergey Popov).

Use AWAutoSetChild and AWAutoSetParent commands - this commands will create child and parent path form current file name
example: 
    let g:aw_stop_word = 'src'
    current file name = '/home/me/project/src/..../.../1.cpp'
    after execution of AWAutoSetChild aw_child_path will be '/home/me/project/'

:AWEditMirrorFile - edit alternate file
:AWDiffMirrorFile - diff current and alternate file
